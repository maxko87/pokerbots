/*
 * High-level strategies:
 * 
 * 1) Value betting. This is what we are doing normally -- bet based on our own chance of winning, thus playing good hands harder. This will be enough
 * to beat at least 75% of the bots, and we should stick to it as much as we can (the rest of the strategies rely increasingly on psychology, which
 * bots may or may not have).
 * 
 * turn and river (maybe even check/call on the turn and hold off the betting until the river). 
 * 
 * 3) Holding out bluff. Similar to above, but instead of actually having a strong hand, we wait for a board that might make us seem like we have a 
 * better hand than the opponent (e.g. three queens on the board after the turn) and we bet hard. This is essentially hoping that our opponent's bot
 * is factoring in our bet sizes in its decisions of whether or not to play -- this might backfire against worse bots that don't do this.
 * 
 * 4) Check raise. If we have a very strong hand on any street and we are on action, we may want to check, let the opponent bet, and then raise them
 * hard. This works well if the opponent is tight and aggressive -- if we can be confident they will bet after our check, we can be sure to take at
 * least some money from them (as opposed to coming out with a strong bet that they might fold to).
 * 
 * 5) Check raise bluff. Same as 4 but without the strong hand.
 *  
 * 
 *  
 *  
 *  For the bluffs, we should make use of getOurAverageBetForFold and getOurAverageRaiseForFold, and maybe a comparable 
 *  getOurAverageBetForCall/Raise -- that way, we may be able to identify a value threshold to which the opponent reliably folds.
 *
