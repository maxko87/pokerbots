 DO:--me, him : (check, bet), add (call, bet) in stataggregator

 DONE: --raise absolute thresholds for playing preflop. (.3,.7)

 --limit raising preflop. 

 	E.g. instead of reraising , if ($ i'm about to raise > 20x potSize), just call instead

 --scale thresholds for playing preflop according to looseness

 	 e.g. banana has 27% (low) looseness preflop. we should

 	 	1) raise more often preflop (reduce threshold for raise)

 	 	2) raise smaller amounts preflop (in order to extract small amounts from him often, but not get caught in trap if he doesn't fold)

 	 e.g. browser has 50% (high) looseness preflop. we should

 	 	1) raise less often preflop

 	 	2) raise larger amounts preflop 

 --fix raise amounts preflop 

 	 small raise = 3-4x pot * winPercentage, absolute maximum of ~20

 	 value raise = (win percentage)^2 * 10 * potSize?


 --do all of the above, with all other streets? 

 --scale absolute cash limits with aggression

 	 e.g. browser has .33*potSize (very high) expected bet preflop. we should

 	 1) call only if we have a very dominant hand (% >
