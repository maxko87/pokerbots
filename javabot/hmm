HEURISTICS (specifically against Tommy, but general too):
1) If they ALWAYS CALL our RAISE, RAISE THEM ALL IN on THE BEST OF HANDS (PREFLOP and FLOP)
2) add PREFLOP RAISING 





1) Instead of figuring out what action to take, we should be determining how much money we want to spend, then take the appropriate action. 
 -- when calling a bet, be a bit more lenient (don't fold)
